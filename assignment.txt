Given a positive integer NUM, find a pair of integers a, b such that
- a and b are positive
- a <= b
- a^2 + b^2 = NUM
- 0<=NUM<=100000

Input - 50
Output - (1,7) , (5,5)
Explanation -
1^2 + 7^2 = 50
5^2 + 5^2 = 50
2) Create a program to print all the palindromes under 50.
Palindrome - A number which read same from backwards as well as forwards
